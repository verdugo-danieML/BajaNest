# BajaNestVision 

Welcome to BajaNestVision, an innovative deep learning initiative dedicated to environmental research in the stunning Ensenada region of Baja California, Mexico. Our mission is to harness cutting-edge computer vision algorithms to achieve two key objectives:

1. **Nest Segmentation**: We meticulously segment Agila Pescadora nests, delving into their intricate composition.

2. **Inorganic Material Detection**: We pinpoint and quantify the presence of inorganic materials within these nests.

## Project Overview

Our primary focus is on understanding the environmental contamination in the area and its potential impact on the indigenous wildlife and delicate ecosystems. By carefully analyzing the percentage of inorganic materials within these nests, we aim to gauge the extent of environmental pollution and its consequences.
